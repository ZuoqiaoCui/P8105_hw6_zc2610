# Problem 2

```{r}
homicide_data_df = read_csv("./data/homicide-data.csv") %>% 
janitor::clean_names()
```

Create a new variable "city_state" to combine city and state columns

```{r}
homicide_data_df = homicide_data_df %>% 
  mutate(
    city_state = str_c(city, state, sep = ",")
  ) %>% 
  select(-city,-state)
```

Create a new binary variable indicating whether the homicide is solved

```{r}
homicide_data_df = homicide_data_df %>% 
  mutate(
    whether_solved = case_when(
      disposition == "Closed without arrest" ~ "unsolved",
      disposition == "Open/No arrest" ~ "unsolved",
      disposition == "Closed by arrest" ~ "solved"
    )
  )
```
